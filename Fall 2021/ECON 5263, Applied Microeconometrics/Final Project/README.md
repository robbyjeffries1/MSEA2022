**Abstract**

While it is intuitive to expect a causal relationship between a United States county’s political affiliation and policy decisions, it is not immediately obvious if the county’s status of Republican or Democrat alone impacts medical or behavioral outcomes such as COVID-19 case rates, death rates, and vaccination rates. This paper employs a sharp regression discontinuity design to determine if there is a significant difference in these three outcomes between counties that are “just Republican” or “just Democrat,” ceteris paribus, as determined by the popular vote of the 2016 United States Presidential election. The results indicate no significant difference in case, death, or vaccination rates between counties transitioning from a slight Democratic majority to a slight Republican majority. This model can be employed in future research to answer questions such as the impact of face covering policies on COVID-19 vaccination rates.
