### What is a model?

```{r}
sim1 <- modelr::sim1

range(sim1)

ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()

```

Looks linear, or $$ Y = B_0 + B_1\phi_1(x) $$

Let's now create *many* naive models

```{r}

models <- tibble(
  a1 = runif(1000, -20, 40),
  a2 = runif(1000, -5, 5)
)

# view the data
models

ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2), 
              data = models, alpha = 1/4) +
  geom_point()

```

Many of these models are terrible. How shall we pick the best one?

One idea: let's minimze the distance between the model (the *"prediction"*) and the observed data (the *"response"*).

```{r}

model1 <- function(a, data) {
  a[1] + data$x * a[2]
}
model1(c(7, 1.5), sim1)

```

It was at this moment that I couldn't keep up. :)
