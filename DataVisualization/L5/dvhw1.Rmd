### Load Necessary Libraries

Let's load some necessary libraries, but first, let's show a little more RMarkdown syntax, specifically, a list: 

- this is how to **bold** text 
- this is how to *italicize* text 
- this is how to ***bold italicize*** 
- this is a [link to some html](http://www.google.com) 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggthemes)
```

### Step 2. Filter the data

We wish to show a df of flights on March 10, specifically Delta flights that originated at EWR.

``` {r}
flights %>%
  filter(month==3, 
         day==10, 
         carrier=="DL", 
         origin=="EWR") %>%
  count()
```
