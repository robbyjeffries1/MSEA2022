#### Please show all your code for each step


## Step 1. Install/ load required libraries
## You'll need the packages 'tidyverse' and 'nycflights13'
## Hint: you need the install.packages() and library() commands


## Note we will exclusively use the 'flights' dataset from 'nycflights13'
#
## Step 2. On March 10, 2013, how many Delta flights (carrier code "DL")
## originated at Newark ("EWR")?  Show a dataframe/ tibble.
#
## (Hint: you're going to want multiple filters)

## Step 3. Generate a histogram of the departure delays for each NYC airport.

## Step 4. For flights from JFK ONLY, generate a tibble showing the average 
## flight time (time in the air), grouped by the hour of the day it took off.
## Additionally show the average number of flights occuring at that hour every day.

     ########[ YOUR CODE HERE]###########


## Step 5.  Using the df from above, generate a col chart with hour of the day on the x axis, and average
## flight time on the y axis.
## (Hint, you want to use geom_col())
