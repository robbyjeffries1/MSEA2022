# Set time of phone call
t = int(input('At what hour would you like to call the driver?\n'))

# Calculate drive time and break time
drive_time = (t//10)*6

remainder = (t%10)

if remainder <= 6:
    drive_time += remainder
else:
    drive_time += 6
    break_time += (remainder-6)

print("The driver's total drive time is", drive_time, "hours.")
print("The driver's total break time is", break_time, "hours.")
